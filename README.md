# Getting Started

<p>Before you proceed, ensure you have completed the initial setup for React Native Expo. If not, please follow the <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/">Expo - Getting Started</a> guide.</p>

# Starting the Development Server

<p>To start the development server, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>npx expo start</code></pre>

<p>When you run this command, the Expo CLI starts a development server and generates a QR code.</p>

# Using Expo Go

<p>Expo Go is a free, open-source sandbox for learning and experimenting with React Native on Android and iOS devices. It's not recommended for building production-quality apps or deploying/distributing apps. Instead, use it to experiment and learn.</p>

<p>To use Expo Go:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install Expo Go on your device. It is available on both the Android Play Store (for Android Lollipop 5 and greater) and iOS App Store (for iOS 13 and greater).</li>
  <li>When you run <code>npx expo start</code> in your project, the development server generates a QR code.</li>
  <li>On your Android device, open the Expo Go app and press "Scan QR Code" on the Home tab. Scan the QR code to connect to the development server.</li>
  <li>On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple Camera app and scan the QR code to connect to the development server.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use Expo Go to quickly test your app on real devices and experiment with new ideas.</p>

# Local Development

<p>For local development, refer to the <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-app-development/">Local App Development guide</a>. This guide provides essential information to optimize your development workflow.</p>

Local App Compilation</p>

<p>To build your project locally, you can use compile commands from Expo CLI, which generate the <code>android</code> and <code>ios</code> directories:</p>

<pre><code>npx expo run:android</code></pre>

<pre><code>npx expo run:ios</code></pre>

<p>These commands will compile your app for Android and iOS, respectively.</p>

Congratulations! :tada:

<p>You've successfully initiated and customized your React Native Expo App and are ready to explore it with Expo Go. :partying_face:</p>
